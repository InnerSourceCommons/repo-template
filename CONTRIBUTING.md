# How to Contribute

Thank you for considering helping out!

Looking to update information or feature your project? Feel free to make the change yourself. 

First, please read the code of conduct. We take it very seriously!

Next, if you want to help out, do the following:

1. Fork the project.
2. Make a feature branch with the name of your change.
3. Make a change.
4. Commit your code.
5. Issue a Pull Request.

Once your PR is issued, we will review your work and decide on adding it to the project!

# Contributing source code

# How to become a Trusted Committer
This section should make the process for becoming a Trusted Committer explicit if that route is open to contributors.

# How to nominate Trusted Committers
This section serves as a reminder to existing and explanation for new Trusted Committers detailing how to add others to the host team. Again ideally this information is identical for all projects in the organization so central information can be linked to from here.
