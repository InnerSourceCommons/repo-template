# Creating an InnerSource License

Creating an InnerSource License customized to the needs of the organization in question (and their legal entities). This license needs to be generic enough to be applied to the most important inter-company relationships.

It is important to write the InnerSource License such that it truly allows for open source style collaboration across the boundaries of the involved legal entities. Therefore the 4 freedoms of free software should be integrated into the license.

The License is written as a formal legal document, and can be used as part of contracts between the legal entities to govern the code sharing agreements.
